# Data Cleaning and Fastai

As was obvious in my previous blog the data set was not perfect. Additionally there are things like cartoon images such as angry birds in my bird folder. This causes noise in the data set and therefore, hurts the accuracy of the model.

Dataset pruning is an important step in all machine learnig, including tools like GPT 4. Data pruning additionally increases the speed of training a model, and making the data more interpretable for an end user investigating the model.

Pruning can be done using the model itself. One way to do this is to run the model against it's own dataset, remove mismatches and then retrain the model. This can save time on manual pruning, but could potentially lead to the model skewing itself in the wrong direction if it had a larger volume of noise.
