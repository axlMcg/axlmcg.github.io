# Starting Up With Fastai

Fastai is an ai machine learing tool that allows for easy training and testing of datasets through heavy abstractaction.
Fastai like many AI tools is still under development and therefore, has many unexpected issues crop up.

Due to this I have really put off this assignment. It's been a bit of a nighmare to learn these tools, and some of my repos were
unable to be setup.
