# Starting Up With Fastai
![fastAiLogo](images/logo.png)

Fastai is an ai machine learing tool that allows for easy training and testing of datasets through heavy abstractaction.
Fastai like many AI tools is still under development and therefore, has many unexpected issues crop up.

Due to this I have really put off this assignment. It's been a bit of a nighmare to learn these tools, and some of my repos were
unable to be setup.

For my questiom 2 I used the 00 is it a bird example. I ran into an immediate issue however...
Scraping images was borked.



the particular issue can be seen in this block of code

~~~
searches = 'bird', 'cow', 'bat', 'turtle', 'lion', 'panda', 'horse', 'giraffe', 'beaver', 'elephant'
path = Path('animal_identification')

for o in searches:
    dest = (path/o)
    dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o}'))
    sleep(10)
    resize_images(path/o, max_size=400, dest=path/o)
~~~

So How did I go about fixing this?

Well luckly for me as a non-pioneer these issues were well treaded.

It turns out that there is a function that can be used to replace this from the fastai repo

~~~
searches = 'bird', 'cow', 'bat', 'turtle', 'lion', 'panda', 'horse', 'giraffe', 'beaver', 'elephant'
path = Path('animal_identification')

for o in searches:
    dest = (path/o)
    dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o}'))
    sleep(10)
    resize_images(path/o, max_size=400, dest=path/o)
~~~

This allowed it to run successfully and gathered images.

This reflects the universal trend of machine learning. It is one of the most emergent fields and is undergoing constant development. Even within the last year we have seen chatgpt go from gpt3.5 to gpt4 with exponential improvement to problem solving and answer certainty.
